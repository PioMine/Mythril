### Instalation

The instalation should be straightforward, but as Mythril is still in development it might be complicated at first. 

1. Download the .dmg file from the latest [release on our Github](https://github.com/PioMine/Mythril/releases)
2. Go to the Downloads folder on your Mac. ~/Users/username/Downloads
3. Double click the Mythril_Download.dmg file, or right click it, and click open. 
4. In the .dmg file, Drag the Mythril app to the Applications folder.
5. Open the Mythril application, located in your Applications folder, **or** open via searchlight. 

:exclamation: From here on now, the instalation will follow the Development path. This **will** be changed later on. :exclamation:

Because the application is in early development, it does not have a dev signature. MacOS will probably detect it as a threat and stop you from opening it. To overcome this, follow these steps:

1. Open System Preferences
2. Open the "Privacy & Security" page in system preferences
3. Scroll down to the "Security" section.
4. Click on "Open Anyways", next to the warning. If it does not show up, try launching Mythril again, dismiss the warning **without deleting the application**, and check again. 

MacOS will prompt you to enter your password to make sure you know what you are doing. If you have any doubts, i encourage you to check the files on github for malware. 

**If MacOS does not detect Mythril as a threat, click on "Open Anyways" when prompted** 


### Thanks

Thank you all for checking this project out. These are all the components that build the browser itself. (yes its an opensource-ish)
